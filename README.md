Automated Plant Disease Detection System
Overview
The Automated Plant Disease Detection System is an advanced image processing application designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals detect plant diseases early and accurately. The system can identify disease symptoms, assess severity, and provide treatment recommendations by applying computer vision techniques to leaf images.
